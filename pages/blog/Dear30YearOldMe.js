          There is no passion to be found, playing <strong>small</strong> - in settling for a life that is less than the one 
          you are capable of living - Nelson Mandela 

          Dear 30 year old me,

          This is a message from your 21 year old self. In case you don't remember, you've set a goal when you were 16. 
          The goal that no one else knew about. I hope you still remember it. As you know this goal is going to take 
          a lot of time and effort. If we are super lucky, we might reach it when you are 50 or 60. Most likely we will
          never reach it but who cares about likelyness.
        
          As of the time of writing this, life has been rough on you.
          It's your fourth time dropping out of college. You've started 3 different companies, 
          which all failed. You have been a part of 5 other companies which either failed, you partners fired you or you left.
          You have a lot of debt. You've not been in a serious relationship. You've not been in a relationship at all.
          And let me remind you, you have no passport and you have no drivers license. You are not a citizen of any country. And you are living
          on a 100$ a month after rent.

          So why am I telling you this? Even when you were at you worst, you still had hope and dedication to reach your goal.
          So if you are feeling down, just remember that you have been in a worse situation before. And you still managed to get up. 
          it's ok to be a late bloomer.
          
          So don't let all of this go to waste. And remember without consistency, you will never reach your goal.
          Ease is a greater threat to progress than hardship. So don't let the ease of giving up, get to you.

          Keep moving, keep working, keep getting 1% better every day. 

          And remember I am going to be ... or I am going to die too early.
