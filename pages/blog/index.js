      <p>
        This my personal blog where I write about whole different topics. This is kind of hitting two birds with one stone.
        I get to write about topics that I've read about and I get the oppurtunity to let other people challenge my thoughts.
        Kind of a constructive way to get feedback on my thoughts.

          Do you believe in God?
